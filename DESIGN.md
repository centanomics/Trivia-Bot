## Problem Statement

Due to the current pandemic, school has completely transitioned to being an online format for a majority of states within the US. Because of this transition, student communities have been disconnected from the college level all the way down to the middle school level. The constant routine of going in front of a laptop/computer to go to class for this extended amount of time has been detrimental for a lot of students' mental health. Students have become more disengaged from their classes and classwork because of this environment, and choose to be careless about their classes since they feel as though they are not learning and retaining the information they are being taught. Going to class physically is a pivotal part in community building and student mental health because humans in general are very social creatures, and when that social aspect is lacking in their lives, they become uninterested and lack the drive to feel passionate about their schoolwork. This is a major problem with all school curriculums because school is starting to become an environment that isn’t as fun as it used to be. Instead of showing excitement and dedication for new information and to be educated, students are slowly becoming more susceptible to solely focusing on submitting assignments, and putting their mind elsewhere. School does cause a lot of stress, and when students were in person, there were times throughout the school year where they were able to lean on their community for support, and have time for themselves whether it’s through fun events, games, or hanging out with friends. This was all stripped away once they were strapped to their computer screens all the time. 

## Bot Description

```
What does your bot do? Why is a bot a good solution for the problem? Does your bot have a conversation with users (e.g. workers or task managers), provide analytical result for a specific inquiry, or does it just response to events (e.g., new registration/submission events)?

This should be a good two paragraphs.

Finally, devise a tagline for your bot, a simple phrase that captures the entire essence of the bot and your project.
```

## Design Sketches

```
- Create a  sequence flow or state transition mockup of your bot in action.
- Create a storyboard that illustrates the primary task that a user undergoes with bot.
```

## Architecture Design

```
- Create a diagram that illustrates the components of your bot, the platform it is embedded in, third party services it may use, data storage it may require, etc.
- Describe the architecture components in text.

This section should be several diagrams + paragraphs of text. This is the opportunity to really think through how you might build your system. Consider all the criteria listed here in your description. Generic architectures that do not properly reflect a solution will receive low scores.-
```

## Submission

Create a team repository for your bot, using the assigned github repository. Submit a link to your team repo. In your README.md, list all team members and their github ids. Add a DESIGN.md document (linked from README.md) with the following materials included.
