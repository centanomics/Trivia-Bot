## Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

Having to think about design methods and potential solutions allows a team to take a step back and thoughtfully come up with a robust solution instead of just powering through the development process. Mapping out a plan with UML diagrams and creating use cases for example were great skills to learn because they do exactly that. As a group, we were able to catch idiosyncrasies that we could have unknowingly implemented had we not taken the opportunity to think through the project.  

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult thing is being able to think abstractly when planning out the implementation of a project. I found it difficult to think so deeply about someting I didn't know much about yet. There's a lot of research that goes into a software project, so being able to confidently land on an idea, method, or technology isn't an easy thing to do. If I could do something differently, I would implement the project in an object oriented fashion. Right now, the project in its current state fucntions well, but it isn't scalable at all. Being able to leverage the use of class based design would help tremendously and allow the project to be more readable, organized, scalable, reusable, and maintainable. We ran into several major merge conflicts due to the fact that we were all editing the same file on different branches; these were not fun to resolve!

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

We didn't specifically implement any design methods (at least, not knowingly) in our project. Like I mentioned above, I think this project would be more scalable and easier to maintain and add on to if it was Object Oriented. I think I want to refactor this project to use this methodology so that I can continue to add on to it, while also practicing this design method.

## Implementation

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

The internet! That may seem like a silly response to a serious question, but I mean that fully and completely. Being able to leverage the information that is already out there is the best thing you can do as a software developer, and developing the ability to read and understand documentation is a great skill to develop over time. All team members did extensive research while implementing our bot and we learned so much in this process. The research we did and tools that we used really helped the implementation of our project. In regards to the testing aspect, we made use of a Discord Server and created testing channels (one channel per team member) so that we could test our code before opening up PRs. This was a manual process, but making use of Discord was a great tool for us and our purposes. We also used the voice channel features to have our meetings and pair programming sessions (we could screenshare as well). In addition to all of this, we also had a `main-bot` channel where we deployed our main branch to Heroku, and had this channel as a group testing channel of our main branch. The Discord application really helped in being a great tool for development and implementation.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part about implementing our bot was figuring out how to accept responses and getting the bot to wait for those responses. Lots and lots of research was done to figure this out in addition to trial and error. There isn't anything I would do differently here because I think the only way to have figured this out was to do it the way that we did it; by diligently researching and testing.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

In the future, I'd like to make use of continuous integration and testing. We learned about this during a lab and I thought it was so cool and helpful for the software development process. Instead, we would manually test to ensure code wasn't breaking in between merges, and continuous integration does a lot to mitigate that issue. 

## Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

Implementing a kanban board allowed us to visually see what we finished and what we still needed to finish; organization is key in any process, especially in software development, and so the kanban board was crucial. Code review allowed us to ensure only high quality work was being merged into the main codebase, and allowed us to catch bugs. Code review also allowed us to familiarize ourselves with another person's thought process and in turn, made us better programmers.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part was reading someone else's code. This is a tricky thing to do but its a great skill to develop because it enhances your own code quality. Making sure that you're doing a good job in revewing someone else's code is important! That being said, bugs are inevitable and that's okay, but trying your best to ensure quality is difficult but very valuable. I don't think I would do anything differently with our process since it worked very well for us. I'd probably have to discuss this with my teammates to see what they think, but our organization was fantastic and our communication was also great. That definitiely helped to ensure our process was efficient.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

The use of Git, code review, using kanban boards, and labeling issues were really great practices for us. It allowed us to be organized and in turn increased our efficiency. I definitely want to use all of these practices in the future. This semester, the idea of organization and communication was heavily enforced and I really felt like I was a part of a software team, so the organization of our process was vital in making the project a success and making the experience seamless.
