```
Trivia Bot
```

### Describe the problems. (10 minutes)

1. What is the core problem each bot is trying to solve?

    Since school and life in general has transitioned to being online, it has been difficult to participate in virtual events that are fun like they used to be. The problem this bot is trying to solve is the issue of feeling disconnected.

2. Why is it a problem worth solving?

    Just because life is virtual now, doesn't mean it has to be boring! School events and virtual gatherings shouldn't have to be bland just because we can't be together! Trivia Bot will bring the fun back to events like it used to be pre-pandemic. The goal is to make groups of people feel connected again.

### Describe possible designs: (10 minutes)

    To provide a virtual trivia game in the Discord application where users can compete and have fun.
